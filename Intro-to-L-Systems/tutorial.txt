Alphabet: A B

we are gonna recursively make chains with these alphabets
We just consider two random alphabets and take those as axioms, they are not necessarily A and B

Axiom: A

Rules: A-> AB
       b-> BA

And we have n which stands for the total number of the alphabets(known as generation) in the chain

like when n=0--> there is only A

and when n=1--> A-> AB

and when n=2--> A  B
		\  /
		AB BA

and when n=3--> A  B  A
		\  |  /
		AB BA AB

and so on...
we just keep replacing A with AB and B with BA depending upon the number, this System is also knows as a DOL-system


we use string buffer to capture values and append the values of the older string to new string to get a new generated.


We can also use LSystems to draw computer graphics known as the turtle Graphics
Like F for moving forward
G for moving moving backward
+ for turning right
- turn left
[ for saving state(push matrix)
] restate the state(pop matrix)(turtle.position)


In other words, L-Systems are can be called as rewriting the strings, starting from the axiom and going on with the chain.


Intro to Graphic Turtles:
Turtle graphics are often used for L-Systems Interpretation:
	The set of turtle System commands can be used for interpreting the linear set of instructions to a "turtle", which interprets the instructions 
	as geometrical building actions. Each command is supposed to give one single instruction to the turtle in order to make different set of
	turtle graphics.
We usually use Python3 for making turtle graphics because python has a turtle library that has all the required graphics for making these fancy graphics.



Applications of LSystems:
1) Herbaceous Plants
2) Neural Networks
3) The procedural designs of cities
4) Generative Art
5) Generative Music


Initially, LSystems were considered as the mathematical theory of plant development. The main emphasis was always on the plant topology, trying to 
create new structures of the Plants so that they can capture the cell divisions in the multicellular organisms.


We can use the turtle graphics to draw simple and complictaed structures, espically using recursion to draw multiple branches.
