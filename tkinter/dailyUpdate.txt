Intro to L-systems
I referred to a website to learn the introdunction to L-systems. The URL of the website is https://morphocode.com/intro-to-l-systems/

I learned that an LSystem is a parallel string rewriting system. All the LSystems work on a basic set of rules for specifying the symbols in a string. The symbols are 
rewritten as strings. 
For example:
seed: A
The rules are:
Rule 1: A=AB
Rule 2: B=BA

Next, the LSystems by default start with the seed=A and iteratively rewrites that string using the production rules. n i usually defined as the derivation length of the
string, which is further equal to the number of iterations. 

n=0:A
n=1:AB(A becomes AB according to Rule #1)
n=2: ABBA(A becomes AB according to RUle #1, while B becomes BA according to Rulw #2. In result we get ABBA)
n=3: ABBABAAB
n=4: ABBABAABBAABABBA
and so on...


So basically each string represents a word. All words from the language of the System. 
The next is learning the different types of LSystems: deterministic, stochastic, context-free, context-sesitive, parametric, timed-depending on the rules and the way they 
are applied by the LSystem.

The applications of the LSystems are: 
1: herbaceous plants
2: neural networks
3: the procedural design of cities
4: generative art
5: generative music
